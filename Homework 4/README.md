**CHEG 472: Homework 3**

**Project Overview:** This repository contains Python code for four homework assignments related to chemical engineering processes. Each assignment addresses a specific topic:

1. Oxygen Transfer Rate (OTR) in Wastewater Treatment: Simulates DO levels in an aeration tank and calculates OTR based on various parameters.
2. Liquid-Liquid Extraction: Calculates distribution ratios and plots tie-line diagrams for ternary liquid-liquid systems.
3. Distillation Column Design: Calculates the number of theoretical stages using the McCabe-Thiele method and plots equilibrium curves.
4. Chemical Reactor Design: Compares CSTR and PFR reactors for a first-order irreversible reaction and calculates reactor volumes.

**Usage:**

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/mayafetzer/Data-Science-in-Chemical-Engineering

Navigate to the Desired Assignment:

cd otr_simulation  # or liquid_liquid_extraction, distillation, or chemical_reactors

Run the Python Script:

python app.py

Follow the Instructions: 
The app will provide a user interface with instructions and input fields. Enter the required parameters and observe the results.

**Dependencies:**

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For plotting.

Streamlit: For creating interactive web applications (optional, depending on the implementation).
